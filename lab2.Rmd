## Topics

* `termplot`  Base R
* `avPlots` from  `library(car)`  
* `boxTidwell`  from  `library(car)`  
* `boxCox`   from  `library(car)`  



## Termplot Example

```{r simdata, echo=T}
n = 100
logx1 = rnorm(n)
x1 = exp(logx1)
x2 = abs(rnorm(n))
logy = .5 + 3*logx1 - 2*sqrt(x2) + rnorm(n)
simdat = data.frame(X1=x1, X2 = x2, Y=exp(logy))
```

## Termplot output
```{r}
termplot(lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data=simdat), terms = "X1",
         partial.resid = T, se=T, rug=T,
         smooth = panel.smooth)

```

## Termplot output
```{r}
termplot(lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data=simdat), terms = "X2",
         partial.resid = T, se=T, rug=T, 
         smooth = panel.smooth)
```


##  termplot with transformation of Y and X1

```{r}
termplot(lm(log(Y) ~ log(X1) + X2, data=simdat),
         terms = "log(X1)", partial.resid = T, se=T, rug=T, 
         smooth = panel.smooth)
```

##  termplot with transformation of Y and X1

```{r}
termplot(lm(log(Y) ~ log(X1) + X2, data=simdat), terms = "X2",
         partial.resid = T, se=T, rug=T, smooth = panel.smooth)

```

##  termplot with transformation of Y, X1, and X2

```{r}
termplot(lm(log(Y) ~ log(X1) + sqrt(X2), data=simdat), terms = "sqrt(X2)",
         partial.resid = T, se=T, rug=T, smooth = panel.smooth)
```

## What is in a term plot?

*  x-axis is the (untransformed) variable in your dataframe  $(X1, X2)$
* line is the "term" of that variable's contribution to $f(x)$ 
* y-axis is partial residuals for term
* `partial.resid = T` adds the partial residuals to the plot
* `rug = T`  shows location of data on axes
* `se = T`  adds the SE of the term's contribution to $f(x)$
* `smooth = panel.smooth`  adds "smoothed" means to plot

##  Terms

$$Y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X2 + e$$
Equivalent to centered model

$$Y = \bar{Y} + \hat{\beta}_1 (X1 - \bar{X1}) + \hat{\beta}_2 (X2 - \bar{X2}) + e$$
Terms are coefficient estimates times centered predictors
 $$\hat{\beta}_1 (X1 - \bar{X1}) $$
 $$\hat{\beta}_2 (X2 - \bar{X2}) $$

##  Terms with transformations

$$\log(Y) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \log(X1) + \hat{\beta}_2 X2 + e$$
Equivalent to centered model

$$\log(Y) = \bar{\log(Y)} + \hat{\beta}_1 (\log(X1) - \bar{\log(X1)}) + \hat{\beta}_2 (X2 - \bar{X2}) + e$$
Terms are coefficient estimates times centered "predictors"
 $$\hat{\beta}_1 (\log(X1) - \bar{\log(X1)}) $$

## partial residuals for a term

$$\log(Y) = \bar{\log(Y)} + \hat{\beta}_1 (\log(X1) - \bar{\log(X1)}) + \hat{\beta}_2 (X2 - \bar{X2}) + e$$

$$\log(Y) - (\bar{\log(Y)} + \hat{\beta}_1 (\log(X1) - \bar{\log(X1)})) =  \hat{\beta}_2 (X2 - \bar{X2}) + e$$

* Lefthand side takes response and removes the part of the response that is explained by $X1$  

* Equal to the `term` for $X2$ plus the residual $e$

* part of residual variation that is not explained by the other terms that potentially can be explained by $X2$  = partial residual for $X2$

* partial residual for X1  

$$\hat{\beta}_1 (\log(X1) - \bar{\log(X1)})  + e$$
## Added Variable Plots

From `library(car)`

```{r}
library(car)
mod1 = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data=simdat)
avPlots(mod1)
```

In the added variable plot, on the left we regress $Y$ on $X2$ and find the residuals ($Y$ axis) and plot against the residuals from regressing $X1$ on $X2$ and plot those residuals on the $x$ axis.  If after removing the effect of $X2$ on both $Y$ and $X1$, $X1$ can explain the residual variation, then we should see a relationship in the plot.   The slope of the line in the added variable plot is the adjusted regression coefficient.  (See HW)
Like termplot this can also show if the linear term in $X1$ is appropriate or perhaps there is a nonlinear relationship or if there are outliers or influential points that affect the adjusted relationship. 



## BoxTidwell

```{r}
data("Prestige")
```

```{r}
pairs(Prestige)
```


```{r}
boxTidwell(prestige ~ income + education, ~ type + poly(women, 2), data=Prestige)
```


## BoxCox

```{r}
boxCox(lm(prestige ~ income + education + type + poly(women, 2), data=Prestige))
```

see `help(boxCox)` for generalizations for non-positive responses
